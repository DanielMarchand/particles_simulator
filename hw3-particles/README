# Basic usage and installation:

Ensure that both google test is installed

$ cd $SP4EHW_ROOT/hw3/src

$ mkdir build && cd build && ccmake ..
$ make
The message 'CMake produced the following output /usr/lib/libgtest.a' may appear. This is normal.

Confirm proper installation by running the test:

$ ./test_pingpong

To generate a set of initial data a python script 'generate_input.py' is provided
As well as a demo 'sample_input.txt' text input

To run the code execute the following:

$ mkdir dumps
$ $HW3/src/build/particles <n timesteps> <dump freq> <input file> ping_pong 0.01


To visualize the output run the following steps:
(A basic familiarity with paraview is assumed)

1) Launch paraview (tested on 5.4.1)
2) open $MYDIR/dumps/steps-..csv
