1) Clone the repository from C4Science to $SP4E_HW
2) cd into $HW2
3) compile the hw2_program (from the $HW2 directory)

   $ mkdir build && cd build && ccmake .. && make

4) from the build directory the hw2_program may be run as:

   $./src/main <series_type> <dumper_type> max_iter freq <filepath optional>

For the series_type there are two options:
  algebraic: computes sum over N
  pi: computes an approximation for pi

For dumper_type there are two options:
  print: prints the output to the screen
  write: writes the output to <filepath>, which defaults to my_file.txt in the build directory
         the file type will be determined by extension:
         txt " " seperation, csv "," seperation, psv "|" seperation

max_iter: gives the maximum number of iterations

freq: gives the frequency of the output

filepath determines the output file, see write option under dumper_type

5) The results may be plotted using the "plot_results.py" script,
   located at $HW2/src/plot_results.py

$plot_results.py <input_file> <output_file optional>

input_file: the input file to be plotted, only txt, csv and psv supported
            which was produced earlier by the hw2_program
output_file: the path to an output file containing a plot of the data,
             if left unspecified, plots results to screen
